        PII is personally identifiable information such as your name, telephone
        number, and any other non-public information about you that is
        associated with or linked to any of the foregoing information. Personal

      <span class="c1"
        >- Sign-up. When you sign up for OnMyWay! you are not asked to provide
        any PII. We use a third party to create an anonymous, random ID that is
        associated with your OnMyWay! app instance. We store this ID in our
        database to enhance the user experience in OnMyWay! by associating it
        with your usage activity.</span

        it and retain it to enhance the user experience. To support core
        functionality we may collect and retain the recipient phone number you
        provide for the text message ("sms") that is sent. In some use cases we
        use a third party to facilitate the sms, this third party inherently
        collects and retains the sms content and recipient phone number.</span
